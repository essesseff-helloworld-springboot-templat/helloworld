# helloworld Application (Spring Boot)

Java Spring Boot implementation with trunk-based development and GitOps-driven deployments via Argo CD to Kubernetes (see related repositories), with *optional* process orchestration, reporting, etc. via the essesseff DevOps platform available on a per essesseff app subscription.

## essesseff App GitHub Repository Structure 

* Source: helloworld (this repo)
* Helm Config DEV: helloworld-config-dev
* Helm Config QA: helloworld-config-qa
* Helm Config STAGING: helloworld-config-staging
* Helm Config PROD: helloworld-config-prod
* Argo CD Config DEV: helloworld-argocd-dev
* Argo CD Config QA: helloworld-argocd-qa

## Develop, Build and Deploy 

* **Branch Strategy**: Single `main` branch (trunk-based)
* **Auto-Build**: GitHub Actions image build runs on code push to `main` branch
* **Auto-Deploy**: DEV CI/CD deployment subsequent to successful image build
* **ClickOps Promote/Deploy/Re-Deploy/Rollback**: DEV, QA, STAGING, PROD (via essesseff UX)
* **GitOps Deploy**: DEV, QA, STAGING, PROD (managed by Argo CD by updating config-env Chart.yaml/values.yaml)
* **API Promote/Deploy**: DEV, QA, STAGING, PROD (via essesseff public API)

## Onboarding

If an essesseff subscriber, it is highly recommended that you use the [essesseff onboarding utility](https://www.essesseff.com/docs/deployment/essesseff-onboarding-utility) from a shell terminal with kubectl access to your K8s cluster(s) to onboard to essesseff, GitHub, Argo CD and K8s typically in under 5 minutes per essesseff app, or otherwise similarly make use of the [essesseff public API](https://www.essesseff.com/docs/api) for onboarding.  Otherwise, the essesseff UX and shell terminal with kubectl access to your K8s cluster(s), in combination with onboarding scripts in your essesseff app argocd-env repos, may also be used to onboard your essesseff app(s) to essesseff, GitHub, Argo CD and K8s.

If not an essesseff subscriber, you can still freely use all of the repos in this golden path template, edit app name and namespace labels according to your needs (typically via global string replacements in the file names and contents), and then run the onboarding scripts included in each of your argocd-env repos from a shell terminal with kubectl access to you K8s cluster(s) to get fully onboarded to GitHub, Argo CD and K8s in about ~20 minutes.

## Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
git commit -am "Add feature"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 4. After review, merge to main
# This triggers automatic build

# 5. *If an essesseff subscriber*, upon successful build completion, Helm config-dev Chart.yaml and values.yaml will be automatically updated with the newly built image tag, triggering Argo CD DEV (see argocd-dev repo) to trigger automated deployment to DEV Kubernetes.

# 6. Use essesseff UI for promotions:
#    - Developer declares Release Candidate
#    - QA accepts RC → deploys to QA (or alternatively rejects the promotion of the RC to QA)
#    - QA marks as Stable (or alternatively rejects the promotion to Stable)
#    - Release Engineer deploys from Stable Release to STAGING/PROD
```

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

* Java 17 or higher
* Maven 3.6+
* Docker (for containerization)

### Running Locally

```bash
# Using Maven
mvn spring-boot:run

# Or build and run the JAR
mvn clean package
java -jar target/helloworld-1.0.0.jar

# With custom port
PORT=8080 mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Development with Hot Reload

```bash
# Run with Spring Boot DevTools (included in pom.xml)
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Docker

```bash
# Build container
docker build -t helloworld:local .

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:8080 helloworld:local

# Run with custom port
docker run -p 9090:9090 -e PORT=9090 helloworld:local
```

## Endpoints

* `/` - Main page with version information (HTML)
* `/health` - Health check (returns JSON)
* `/ready` - Readiness check (returns JSON)

## Technology Stack

* **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.2.1
* **Language**: Java 17
* **Build Tool**: Maven 3.9
* **Container**: Docker with multi-stage build
* **Base Image**: Eclipse Temurin 17 JRE Alpine
* **Package**: com.example.helloworld

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
mvn test

# Run tests with coverage
mvn test jacoco:report

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Test readiness endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/ready

# Test main page
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

## Building

```bash
# Build JAR
mvn clean package

# Build without tests
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Build Docker image
docker build -t helloworld:latest .
```

## Deployment

The application is built automatically and ready to deploy to DEV environment after changes are merged to `main` branch and automatic code build succeeds. If an essesseff subscriber, essesseff updates the Helm config-dev Chart.yaml and values.yaml with the newly built image tag, triggering Argo CD DEV (see argocd-dev repo) to deploy the image and DEV config to Kubernetes DEV.  Promotion to QA, STAGING, and PROD environments is managed through the essesseff platform.

### Container Image Tags

Container images are tagged with the format:
```
{semver}-{git-hash}-{timestamp}
```

Example: `1.0.0-a1b2c3d-20231201T120000Z`

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) handles:
* Building the Docker image
* Pushing to GitHub Container Registry
* Generating build metadata
* Triggering essesseff deployment to DEV

## Health Checks

The application includes health check endpoints that can be used by:
* Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes
* Load balancers
* Monitoring systems

## Additional Notes

* The application runs as a non-root user in the container for security
* Multi-stage Docker build optimizes image size
* Health checks are included in the Dockerfile
* Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features
